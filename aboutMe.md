## About me

My name is Bernardo and I was born in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1988 but raised in Madrid since 1992. In 2006 I started my studies in Physics at Universidad Complutense de Madrid finishing the five years degree in 2013. In 2014, I combined my first job as a COBOL developer studying a Master's in Geophysics and Meteorology at the University of Granada.

Nearly 2 years later, I left COBOL for transitioning towards software development applied to build webs and apps, specializing in backend development.

Since 2021, encouraged by combining my software developer skills with the analytical capacity inherited from my Physics studies, I changed my role as a Data Analyst, particularly interested in time series analysis and increasingly in everything related to NLP and LLMs. 

Regarding my personal life, I dedicate my free time to reading (literature, politics, scientific outreach, etc.), learning languages, and going on bike excursions.
