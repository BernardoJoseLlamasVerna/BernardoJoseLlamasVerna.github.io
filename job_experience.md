# Job Experience

Here you can find a detailed timeline of my professional experience in each company and project I've been involved in, including the technologies I used.

## Sngular (2018 - current)

### Googlers Team (2024 - current)
Following the formalization of a strategic partnership with Google, Sngular established a team of GCP technology experts.Their mission was to develop Proofs of Concept (PoCs) for prospective clients. 

These projects spanned various areas, from Data Analysis to the application of Generative AI for diverse tasks, including RAGs, Agents, and Computer Vision.

**Technologies:** GCP, BigQuery, Vertex AI, Looker, ADK, VectorSearch, Python, Docker.

**Rol:** LLM Engineer, ML Engineer, Data Analyst, Software Developer.

### Extract Skills (2024 - 2024)
The 'Extract Skills' project began as an internal Sngular initiative for its own HR team. The goal was to streamline the process of finding the best internal candidates for a given job opening by leveraging the power of Generative AI.

My initial role involved developing a prompt to instruct a Generative AI on how to extract the required skills from a job description. Once the skills were extracted, and to mitigate the variability in the LLM's responses, I utilized NLP tools (specifically Jaccard similarity) to identify skills most akin to those in Sngular's database, which are linked to employee profiles.

LangChain and LangSmith tools were employed for connecting to and calling the LLM, for developing and testing the prompt, and to ensure a consistent JSON output format.

**Technologies:** LangChain, LangSmith, NLP, Python, Docker.

**Rol:** LLM Engineer, Prompt Engineer, Software Developer.

### Pfizer (2021 - 2023)
